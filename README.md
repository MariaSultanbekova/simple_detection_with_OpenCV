## Hi! This is a simple project about detection with OpenCV
Code https://github.com/MariaSultanbekova/simple_detection_with_OpenCV/blob/main/spongebob_detection.py

So, all we need is to install the OpenCV library. 
Then, we will transfer the image to another color space(HSV) and set thresholds for each channel.
I have created an interactive window with which you can find out the upper and lower threshold(just use the commented code and change the mask parameters).

Then just draw a square that will follow spongebob
